# MODULE 5 CHALLENGE
This project reviews the `groupby` and `pivot_table` capabilities in Pandas. The module 5 challenge includes an example dataset for two years of sales records for various retail locations.

The source code is located at the root of this repository within the `athletic_sales_analysis.ipynb` file. The 2 CSV files are within the `Resources` folder.
